"""
Purpose:
Implements the full workflow for verifying if a detected object matches the item being received or issued in MIMS.

What it does:
Capture a frame from the camera (infra.camera_adapter).
Run YOLO detection (infra.detector_yolo).
Compare detected labels with the item expected in MIMS (infra.validator).
Return a structured result (domain.models.ValidationResult).
Optionally log this validation event (infra.storage).

Used by:
CV_Module.validate_transaction() and possibly the MIMS Inventory Validation workflow
